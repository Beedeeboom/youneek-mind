## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

### R5 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE & SCOPE:


* PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION: 

    Youneek Mind is an application designed to teach autistic children the meaning of empathy, how it affects our interactions with others and how it helps us to adjust to social situations. 

    The application is like a story book which could be used every night before bed time. In my own experience when my son was around the age of 6 we would read a bedtime story every night and very often he would pick the same book to read over and over again. I noticed after a while that he would remember the story and apply some of the things he learnt from the story into every day life. I believe with a repetition of use, Youneek Mind could have the potential to help the user to remember each case scenario within the game and how he was able to show empathy within that situation and then apply that outcome to everyday life. 

* DEMOGRAPHIC: 

    The application is created for primary school students between the ages of 5-12 years diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. According to Prof Lenroot, from Neuroscience Research Australia, experiencing empathy is one of the biggest challenges for children with autism spectrum disorders. Youneek Mind is a fun interactive game which aims to teach it’s user the meaning of empathy in a fun and friendly way.

* HOW THE APPLICATION IS USED:

    Youneek Mind is the story of a little Robot YouNeek who gains life bars when the user answers the right questions. The game starts by a friendly greeting from YouNeek which welcomes the user to the application and describes how the user can help him gain life bars and take him on a journey to Kind Land. The application will present a case scenario to the user at each stop and prompt the user to answer multiple choice questions. If the user answers correctly by selecting a response which shows empathy this will give Youneek 1 life bar and the ability to move to the next stop. Once Youneek has reached his first bar he is able to travel to his first stop to Sad Town, then again a multiple choice question is asked and if the user answers correctly Youneek gains his second life bar and is able to move to the second stop which is Care Station. Once Youneek has reached Care Station, the user is again asked to answer a multiple choice question and if answered correctly, Youneek gains his third bar and is able to move to Lonely Village. The game continues on the same way taking the user to several stops until they reach the final destination in Kind Land where Youneek meets his other robot friends and tells them all about his adventures. The final stop gives the user a badge of awesomeness and congratulates them for helping Youneek on his adventure. The user can select to exit the game or replay.

    Throughout the journey until the user selects the correct answer (“shows empathy”) the application will prompt the user to retry (“Try again, Lucy needs your help”). The user is able to exit the game at anytime by selecting the exit option from the menu.

    As there is quite a bit of reading involved children below the ages of 8 would potentially require the help of their parents to read the stories and guide them to select the correct answer. Youneek Mind can also be used as a bed time story which could be replayed every night just like a normal story book. 
 

### R6 - LIST OF FEATURES:


    Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
    - at least THREE features
    - describe each feature

    Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
    - use of variables and the concept of variable scope
    - loops and conditional control structures
    - error handling

    Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

### R7 - USER INTERACTION & EXPERIENCE:

    Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
    Your outline must include:
    - how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
    - how the user will interact with / use each feature
    - how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

### R8 - CONTROL FLOW OF THE APPLICATION:

        Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
    - show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
    - utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

### R9 - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

    Develop an implementation plan which:
    - outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
    - prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
    - provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

    Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

    > Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items

* Trello Board

    To ensure all features are implented within the application and tasks are prioritized to meet submission deadlines an implementation plan was established using the Trello software. Trello enables the user to project manage by creating a Trello board which lists all tasks that need to be completed within a certain timeframe to meet submission deadlines. Staff members can also be allocated to each task.

### R10 - HOW TO INSTALL & USE THE APPLICATION:

        Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

    You must include:
    - steps to install the application
    - any dependencies required by the application to operate
    - any system/hardware requirements
